# Safe Travels 

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a user-friendly app utilizing Machine Learning/AI

## What it does
Safe Travels monitors eye movement in real-time, alerting the user with a noise if prolonged blinking (which can indicate drowsiness) is detected. In case of emergency, the app can also trigger a call for help. Additionally, it includes a built-in Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) calculator to help users assess their sobriety levels before driving.
